# Blog Integration Fix - RSS Feed Solution

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Your RSS feed at [https://blog.spriyanshu.in/rss.xml](https://blog.spriyanshu.in/rss.xml) is working perfectly, but there was a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue preventing it from loading in your portfolio.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

I've updated your `useBlogPosts` hook with a **hybrid approach**:

### 1. **Primary Method**: RSS2JSON API

- Tries to fetch your RSS feed via RSS2JSON API
- Handles dynamic updates automatically
- Works for most RSS feeds

### 2. **Fallback Method**: Static Data

- Uses your actual blog posts as fallback data
- Extracted from your RSS feed content
- Ensures your blog section always shows content

## 📝 Your Blog Posts Now Display

Based on your RSS feed, these posts are now showing:

### 1. **"Cracking the LLD Interview"**
